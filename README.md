# Windowed_Man_page_reader_for_cygwin_vim
For the Longest time I wished for a man page reader like I wrote for
myself back in 1992. Basically that one was just the man(1) command run inside of an xterm and placed in the background.

The effect would be that when I typed "xman something" then a window
would popup describing the something. I could scroll up and down cut and
paste stuff and continue working in which ever window I had issued the man
command from. This was helpful for those commands whith extensive command
line arguments and for perl with all of its man pages on various subjects.
